# My-first-neural-network
It is a simple neural network to determine the species of animals. 
The network input consists of 5 data:
input 1 - number of legs
input 2 - does it live in water
input 3 - can it fly
input 4 - does it have feathers
input 5 - does it born from eggs

At the output of the network we get 3 possibilities: mammal, bird or fish.

The neural network with training and testing functions is implemented from scratch without the use of any libraries.
