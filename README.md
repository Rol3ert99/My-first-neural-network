# My-first-neural-network
It is a simple neural network to determine the species of animals. <br />
The network input consists of 5 data: <br />
input 1 - number of legs  <br />
input 2 - does it live in water <br />
input 3 - can it fly  <br />
input 4 - does it have feathers <br />
input 5 - does it born from eggs  <br />

At the output of the network we get 3 possibilities: mammal, bird or fish.

The neural network with training and testing functions is implemented from scratch without the use of any libraries.
